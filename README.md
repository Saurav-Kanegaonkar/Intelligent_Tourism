# Intelligent Tourism
  
The main idea of this project is to design a system that will run on most of phones and palms and will be helpful when visiting some new places and cities. This system will be able to find a route using user criteria. It will also be able to estimate time needed to travel from one object to the next and if it is possible, advise which bus line or other public means of transport may be used. It should be helpful for people that want to visit a city without having much information about it.

The system does the following things:
1) Determination of important and necessary places for tourism in that city
2) Determination of the best suitable hotel(s) in the selected city
3) Determination of the optimum plan for sightseeking places
4) Determination of the shortest distance between the selected places
